It's great that you are seeking information on managing your anxiety. Managing anxiety during difficult times can be challenging, but there are many things you can do to help alleviate your symptoms. Here are some tips: 1. Focus on your breathing: Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths in through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This helps calm the mind and reduces stress levels. 2. Progressive muscle relaxation: Starting at your toes, tense all the muscles in that part of your body until you count to ten. Then release and move up your body doing the same thing with each muscle group. This technique can help reduce muscle tension. 3. Try mindfulness meditation: Sit or lie down comfortably and close your eyes. Focus on your breathing and let yourself become more and more relaxed as you inhale and exhale. Let all your stress go into each breath out, leaving you feeling calm and serene. If your mind wanders, simply redirect your focus back to your breathing. 4. Do something you enjoy: Engage in an enjoyable activity that makes you feel good or brings you happiness. This can help shift your mood from negative to positive, making you feel better overall. 5. Talk to someone about how you are feeling: Sometimes just talking through your feelings with someone can make a big difference. If you don't have anyone to talk to, consider calling a helpline. Remember, it's okay to ask for help."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 31777267291, 'load_duration': 538930166, 'prompt_eval_count': 156, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3625000000, 'eval_count': 325, 'eval_duration': 27581000000}
